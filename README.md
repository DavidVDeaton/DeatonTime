# General info

Born out of a frustration with daylight savings and raised by the idea that timezones are becoming more and more obsolete due to the globalization of business, travel and communication; comes a simple way to track time, Deaton Time. Deaton Time is a departure from the current 24 hour clock, which may seem radical but it really is like moving from the imperial system to the metric system. In fact, I did think of naming this whole project Metric Time rather than Deaton Time. Deaton Time consists of 100 seconds in a minute, 100 minutes in an hour and 10 hours in a day. By way of comparision this means that Deaton Hours are longer than standard hours, Deaton Minutes are longer than standard minutes, and Deaton Seconds are shorter than standard seconds.

1 Hour (Deaton) = 2 Hours 24 Minutes (24 Hour Clock)

1 Hour (24 Hour Clock) = 41 Minutes 66.666 Seconds (Deaton)

1 Minute (Deaton) = 1 Minute 26.4 Seconds (24 Hour Clock)

1 Minute (24 Hour Clock) = 69.444 Seconds (Deaton)

1 Second (Deaton) = .864 Seconds (24 Hour Clock)

1 Second (24 Hour Clock) = 1.157 Seconds (Deaton)

However, do not get hung up and frustrated by the conversion.  Just as the distance between two cities does not change when measured in kilometers or miles, the length of a day does not change when measured by a 24 hour clock or Deaton Time.  One system of measurement is simply more intuitive because it is a base 10 system.

Please check out my youtube video where I explain Deaton Time in more detail and view the side by side 24 Hour and 10 Hour Clocks.
